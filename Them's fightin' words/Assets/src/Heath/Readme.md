Feature Description:
Sound/Music will be the focus of my work for The Middle Men Group’s game Them’s Fightin’
Words. The game should almost always be incorporating some sort of audio when running. This
allows for better user engagement and appreciation. Below, an outline describes all the various
game pieces that will require sound or music to play depending on the game piece’s role.
Feature Characteristics:
Background Music:
- Menus: music that is present but will not distract user from interacting with game
- Scenes: music tone and pace will vary depending on the scene
Sounds:
- Player movement: incorporating movement sounds (may or may not change pace)
- Player Fighting: incorporating several fighting sounds
- AI Fighting: incorporating several fighting sounds
- User Interface and Interaction: clicking/dragging and other user-menu interacting
Feature Development:
The sound/music features in Them’s Fightin’ Words will adapt beyond the scope of this
document. Therefore, this document is here to generalize an expectation of what is to come
from these features.
