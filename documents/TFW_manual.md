# Them's Fightin' Words | User Manual

Them’s Fightin’ Words is a unique video game that combines an open-world genre with arcade fighter battles and minigames. While you explore the various locations, you will interact with a variety of  NPCs. You will be given the ability to select where you would like to take the interaction via choices in speech bubbles. These choices, while silly, will lead you into some kind of "fight" with the NPC.​ Perhaps you’d just like to roam the map and try to keep the peace—but, you never know what fightin' words might strike a match.
